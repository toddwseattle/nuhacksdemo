# NU Hacks Demo

This project was used for the angular demo at the wild hacks meeting on 5/17/2017.   A partial [talk track](talktrack.md) is contained within the repository.   the master represents the final state at the end of the demo.   A few companion slides are in the presentation [Hack Angular Wildly](https://www.slideshare.net/toddwarrenseattle/hack-angular-wildly) on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/toddwarrenseattle).

If you are interested in a step by step tutorial, which covers angular.cli, basic components, and creation and wiring of a basic angular service, you can follow the [wildangular tutorial](https://github.com/toddwseattle/wildangular) in a related github repo.

This tutorial also covers the pre-reqs, which are similar.
